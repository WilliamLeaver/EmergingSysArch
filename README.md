# EmergingSysArch

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  For the SOS project we were assigned the task of creating a blinking SOS using timer interupts. These skills were then used to solve the final project which was created for a client who was looking for a prototype controller for their new smart thermostat.
  
- What did you do particularly well?
  In this project I met all of the requirments set by the client. Meeting client requirments should always be top of mind. 
  
- Where could you improve?
  I could improve the projects readablity by making seperate files for the timer, I2C, and UART controls. 
  
- What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I am adding CSS skills as well as prototyping on a TI board to my support network. 
 
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  The ability to understand embedded systems will be very valuable in the coming years as more iOT devices come online. 
  
- How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I followed coding best practices in order to ensure the code could be read through.
